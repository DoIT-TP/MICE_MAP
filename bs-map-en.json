With the sedimentation of the Xindian River, the land became fertile, and early settlers dwelled by the water. They cultivated economic crops such as bean sprouts, jasmine flowers, and bamboo shoots. However, with the development of the modern city, the once soft and fertile fields were paved over with asphalt, natural springs were covered with concrete, and the waterfront villages moved behind high embankments. Gradually, people began to forget the memories of being nurtured by river and land. The Gara Shopping District forms a hub in the living circle pattern. Its components are scattered like stars, aspiring to thrive in the earliest developed southern region of Taipei city. With the upcoming completion of the Wanda Line of the MRT and an improved future of transportation network, there is a vision for a revitalization, merging a robust lifestyle, commercial exchange, the dynamic energy of traditional markets, and cultural memories.",
